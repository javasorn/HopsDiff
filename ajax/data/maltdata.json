It is used with strong yeasts to produce amber and bitter beers. Château Pale Ale malt is kilned longer and is usually better modified, providing a more pronounced flavour than Pilsen 2RS. The enzymatic activity of Château Pale Ale malt is sufficient when used with large proportion of non-enzymatic specialty malts.",

      "Enhances the peculiar taste of wheat beers. Château Wheat Blanc malt is essential in making wheat beers but is also used in barley malt-based beers (3–5%) thanks to its protein level that gives the beer a fuller mouthfeel and enhanced head stability. Wheat has no outer husk and therefore has fewer tannins than barley. Wheat malt is much stickier than barley malt due to the higher protein content and may cause lautering problems if not given a \"Protein Rest\" during the mash.",

As a result Château Vienna malt gives a deeper golden colour to the beer increasing at the same time its body and fullness. Due to the higher kilning temperature, the enzyme activity of Château Vienna malt is slightly lower than that of Pilsen Malt. Nevertheless, our Château Vienna malt has a sufficient enzymatic activity to be used in combination with large proportion of specialty malts.",
